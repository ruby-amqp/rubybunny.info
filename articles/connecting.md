## About this guide

This guide covers connection to RabbitMQ with Bunny, connection error handling, authentication failure handling and related issues.

## What version of Bunny does this guide cover?

This guide covers Bunny 0.9.0.



## Two ways to specify connection parameters

With Bunny, connection parameters (host, port, username, vhost and so on) can be passed in two forms:

 * As a map of attributes
 * As a connection URI string (Ã  la JDBC)


### Using a Map of Parameters

Map options that Bunny will recognize are

 * `:host`
 * `:port`
 * `:user` or `:username`
 * `:pass` or `:password`
 * `:vhost` or `virtual_host`
 * `:tls` or `:ssl`
 * `:heartbeat` or `:heartbeat_interval`, in seconds, default is 0 (no heartbeats)
 * `:timeout`

To connect to RabbitMQ with a map of parameters, pass them to `Bunny.new`. The connection
will be established when `Bunny::Session#start` is called:

``` ruby
conn = Bunny.new(:host => "localhost", :vhost => "myapp.production", :user => "bunny", :password => "t0ps3kret")
conn.start
```

`Bunny.new` returns a connection instance that is used to open channels. More about channels later in this guide.

#### Default parameters

Default connection parameters are

``` ruby
{
  :host      => "127.0.0.1",
  :port      => 5672,
  :ssl       => false,
  :vhost     => "/",
  :user      => "guest",
  :pass      => "guest",
  :heartbeat => 0,
  :frame_max => 131072
}
```

### Using Connection Strings

It is also possible to specify connection parameters as a URI string:

``` ruby
b = Bunny.new("amqp://guest:guest@vm188.dev.megacorp.com/profitd.qa")
b.start
```

Unfortunately, there is no URI standard for AMQP URIs, so while several schemes used in the wild share the same basic idea, they differ in some details.
The implementation used by Bunny aims to encourage URIs that work as widely as possible.

Here are some examples of valid AMQP URIs:

 * amqp://dev.rabbitmq.com
 * amqp://dev.rabbitmq.com:5672
 * amqp://guest:guest@dev.rabbitmq.com:5672
 * amqp://hedgehog:t0ps3kr3t@hub.megacorp.internal/production
 * amqps://hub.megacorp.internal/%2Fvault

The URI scheme should be "amqp", or "amqps" if SSL is required.

The host, port, username and password are represented in the authority component of the URI in the same way as in HTTP URIs.

The vhost is obtained from the first segment of the path, with the leading slash removed.  The path should contain only a single segment (i.e, the only slash in it should be the leading one). If the vhost is to include slashes or other reserved URI characters, these should be percent-escaped.

Here are some examples that demonstrate how `AMQ::Settings.parse_amqp_url` parses out the vhost from connection URIs:

``` ruby
AMQ::Settings.parse_amqp_url("amqp://dev.rabbitmq.com")            # => vhost is nil, so default ("/") will be used
AMQ::Settings.parse_amqp_url("amqp://dev.rabbitmq.com/")           # => vhost is an empty string
AMQ::Settings.parse_amqp_url("amqp://dev.rabbitmq.com/%2Fvault")   # => vhost is "/vault"
AMQ::Settings.parse_amqp_url("amqp://dev.rabbitmq.com/production") # => vhost is "production"
AMQ::Settings.parse_amqp_url("amqp://dev.rabbitmq.com/a.b.c")      # => vhost is "a.b.c"
AMQ::Settings.parse_amqp_url("amqp://dev.rabbitmq.com/foo/bar")    # => ArgumentError
```

### Connection Failures

If a connection does not succeed, Bunny will raise one of the following exceptions:

 * `Bunny::PossibleAuthenticationFailureException` indicates an authentication issue or that connection to RabbitMQ was closed before successfully finishing connection negotiation
 * `Bunny::TCPConnectionFailed` indicates that connection to the host has failed. Either the address is not reachable or DNS entry does not exist. Often may suggest a misconfiguration.


## PaaS Environments

### The RABBITMQ_URL Environment Variable

If no arguments are passed to `Bunny.new` but the `RABBITMQ_URL` environment variable is set, Bunny will use it as connection
URI.


## Opening a Channel

Some applications need multiple connections to RabbitMQ. However, it is undesirable to keep many TCP connections open at the same time because
doing so consumes system resources and makes it more difficult to configure firewalls. AMQP 0-9-1 connections are multiplexed with channels that can
be thought of as "lightweight connections that share a single TCP connection".

To open a channel, use the `Bunny::Session#create_channel` method:

``` ruby
conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch   = conn.create_channel
```

Channels are typically long lived: you open one or more of them and use them for a period of time, as opposed to opening
a new channel for each published message, for example.


## Closing Channels

To close a channel, use the `Bunny::Channel#close` method. A closed channel
can no longer be used.

``` ruby
conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

ch   = conn.create_channel
ch.close
```


## Disconnecting

To close a connection, use the `Bunny::Session#close` function. This will automatically
close all channels of that connection first:

``` ruby
conn = Bunny.new
conn.start

conn.close
```


## Troubleshooting

If you have read this guide and still have issues with connecting, check our [Troubleshooting guide](/articles/troubleshooting.html)
and feel free to ask [on the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure-rabbitmq).


## Wrapping Up

There are two ways to specify connection parameters with Bunny: with a map of parameters or via URI string.
Connection issues are indicated by various exceptions. If the `RABBITMQ_URL` env variable is set, Bunny
will use its value as RabbitMQ connection URI.
